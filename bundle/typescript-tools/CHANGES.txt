0.3.0 to 0.3.1:

  - update TS to v0.9.1-2505-g18875cc (develop branch)

  - fix #32 (EOLs in bin)

  - fix #33 (-1 return in TSScompleteFunc)

0.2.2-1 to 0.3.0:

  - update TS to v0.9.1-2130-g0c53b50 (develop branch, about TS v1.0 release)

  - fix tss command help

  - fix #23 (bin/tss executable bit)

  - primitive types have no completion details #29

  - tss.vim:

    - add `TSSfile`: quickly open project files, with filename completion
    - add `TSSfilesMenu`: quickly open project files, with popup navigation menu
    - add sample keymap
    - guard against tss not running/no python
    - only use shell on windows; fixes #18

0.2.1 to 0.2.2-1:             NOTE: package name changed!

  - same code as 0.2.1, packaged slightly differently:

    - package name changed from `tss` to `typescript-tools`
      (matches repo name, is descriptive and easier to find
       in package lists)

      NOTE: remember to uninstall previous version (named `tss`)

    - Vim plugin reorganised as a filetype plugin
      (so you can just add the repo path to Vim's runtime path
       and enable filetype plugins)

0.2.0 to 0.2.1:

  - store project files in dependency-first order
    (avoids some spurious type errors)

  - updated TS to v0.9.1-376-gad18600

  - patch for #15 (TS issue 1651)

  - several fixes in file `update` handling

  - `update`: show syntax/semantics error count (works around TS issue 1592),
    distinguish updated from added files (highlights file addition accidents);
    for speed in combination with completions, use `update nocheck`, with fallback
    to full `update` when `completions` fails (cf #13,#14)

  - fixes in `completions`, `definitions`, and `showErrors`

  - add `--version` flag, use 'git describe --tags' for versioning

  - improved tests and commandline debugging; add basic Makefile

  - improved file path resolution and normalization

  - `showErrors`: provide category of diagnostic (error/warning)
    and phase which generated it (resolution/syntax/semantics)

  - add `structure` command (getScriptLexicalStructure)

  - tss.vim: rudimentary support for
      - showing file structure `TSSstructure`
      - listing project files `TSSfiles`
      - browsing MDN docs for EcmaScript global object properties&methods

  - partial rewrite, including PROTOCOL CHANGES
    (outlined below, see README.md for details of current protocol)

  - tss v0.2 supports/uses TypeScript v0.9

  - `symbol` command is gone
    (use `type` command instead, properties `fullSymbolName` and `type`)

  - commands now return `{line,character}` records, whereever positions are concerned

  - `completions-brief` command omits `type`/`docComment` details

  - `completions` commands prefilter suggestions, based on identifier prefix before cursor

  - `files` command returns list of files in current project

  - `references` command returns list of reference locations (`getReferencesAtPosition`)

  - improved feature test coverage

  - tss.vim:
    - add TSSreferences command
    - fix preview window handling
    - improved tracing and log file handling
    - set omnifunc only for .ts files
