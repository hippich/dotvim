## typescript-tools.vim

Vim filetype plugin for TypeScript support, based on
https://github.com/clausreinke/typescript-tools.

Needs Vim 7.3 (plus Python 2.7 with json lib).

### Installation/Configuration

1. Install `typescript-tools` globally

  ```
  $ npm install -g clausreinke/typescript-tools
  ```

  The installation should give you a global `tss` command (try `tss --version`).

2. To use tss from Vim, add the `typescript-tools.vim` directory to your Vim's `rtp`.

  ```
  filetype plugin on
  au BufRead,BufNewFile *.ts		setlocal filetype=typescript
  set rtp+=<your_path_here>/typescript-tools.vim/
  ```

3. `tss` can be configured the same way as `tsc`, either via commandline options or
  via `tsconfig.json` files (since about TSv1.5). In both cases, only options that
  affect the language service have any effect.

  To change how `tss` is invoked, you can use the `g:TSS` variable (defaults to
  `['tss']`, assuming a globally installed `tss` command, as above).  For
  instance, ubuntu users may want to invoke `tss` via `nodejs` (different name
  for `node`)
  ```
  let g:TSS = ['nodejs','<path-to-tss>']
  ```
  or you may want to pass commandline options for all your projects (for
  project-specific options, a `tsconfig.json` file may be the better choice)
  ```
  let g:TSS = ['tss','--module','commonjs']
  ```

### Usage tips

  1. the plugin collaborates with a tss server running in the background (via python and nodejs)
  2. the tss server will pick up source file dependencies (via import and references)
  3. start the tss server while editing your main source file (or your main reference file), by issueing `:TSSstarthere`, or `:TSSstart <main.ts>` (the latter allows you to pass options, the former is just a shorthand)
  4. now you can use the other commands (or `:TSSend`, to get rid of the background server), even while opening TS sources from the same project in different windows or tabs (but in the same Vim instance)

  In practice, you'll use `:TSSstarthere`, `:TSSend`, `:TSSreload`, `TSStype`,
  `TSSdef*`, as well as CTRL-X CTRL-O for insert mode completion. Also try the
  project (file) navigation commands. Sometimes, calling `:TSSshowErrors`
  directly can give enough error information for the current file --
  eventually, you'll probably have to call `:TSSreload` to account for changes
  in dependencies.
